%KMGWO  is an improvement in Grey Wolf Optimizer
%which includes K-means algorithm to divide the population of GWO into different clusters, 
%the results shows that KMGWO is better than GWO in several  benchmark functions.

%% % KMGWO modification source codes by % % Hardi M. Mohammed  % % % %
% % we improved the code of GWO which have been written by mirjalili % % then we hybridize GWO algorithm with K-means. % %%
% disclaimer CODE of  GWO are taken from mirjalili website project
% code which is: http://www.alimirjalili.com/Projects.html 


How it works:
You only need to Run the main.m using matlab software
then you can see the results
by running the main file KMGWO runs 30 time ( each time includes 500 iterations)
Results prints 30 best_Score and then shows the average of them
all files must be in the same directory.
